            <p>A humanitarian crisis (or sometimes humanitarian disaster) is defined as a singular event or a series of
                events that are threatening in terms of health, safety or well-being of a community or large group of
                people. It may be an internal or external conflict and usually occurs throughout a large land area.
                Local, national and international responses are necessary in such events.</p>

            <h3><strong>Food Distribution Under FFA, FFT, And Resilience Program</strong></h3>
            <p>Through FFA, food insecure households receive cash or food-based transfers to address their immediate
                food needs, freeing up their time to build or rehabilitate assets, such as constructing a road or
                rehabilitating degraded land, that will have long-term impacts, creating healthier natural environments,
                reducing risks and the impact of shocks, increasing food productivity, and strengthening resilience to
                natural disasters.</p>

        <!-- Drought Relief and Recovery -->
        <div class="section">
            <h3><strong>Drought Relief And Recovery</strong></h3>
            <p>Drought is a prolonged dry period in the natural climate cycle that can occur anywhere in the world. It
                is a slow-onset disaster characterized by the lack of precipitation, resulting in a water shortage.
                Drought can have a serious impact on health, agriculture, economies, energy and the environment.</p>

        <!-- Cash Transfer -->
        <div class="section">
            <img src="cash-transfer.png" alt="Cash Transfer">
            <h3><strong>Cash Transfer</strong></h3>
            <p>Sending money to people is empowering. When a disaster strikes, or conflict flares, money is often the
                first thing people need to buy food or pay for transport and temporary accommodation to get out of
                harm’s way. Not everyone needs the same thing at the same time. SAIF sends people money to give them the
                flexibility to choose what they need, when they need it. People spend most of the money SAIF sends them
                on food, but they also can use it to pay medical bills, rent or school fees. Sending people money means
                that they don’t need to make impossible trade-offs, like deciding to eat less so that they can keep all
                their children in school.</p>

            <p>To resolve the siltation problem and boost food security, the county and national governments have
                embarked on an extensive project to desilt canals. The county department of agriculture said the project
                has enabled farmers to increase their farm acreage, thereby increasing food production in the area.</p>
