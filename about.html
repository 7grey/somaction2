            <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
            <h2>Soma-Action International Fund</h2>
            <p>SOMA-ACTION is a Non-Governmental Organization formed in 1992 and based in Elwaq-District Gedo region and
                Lower Shebelle Region of Somalia. With its main office in Elwak, it has staff in El Waq and Marka
                Somalia.
                SOMA-ACTION has over twenty years (20) of experience in designing and implementing community-based
                relief,
                rehabilitation, and development and peace projects. One of the major assets of SOMA-ACTION is its
                qualified
                professionals who have experience in the fields of program design and implementation. During its
                existence,
                the organization has managed to conduct various needs assessments through participatory methods to
                assess
                the priority needs of the local people. SOMA-ACTION has a wealth of experience in partnership building
                and
                collaborated with various UN agencies, International NGOs, and members of the community to implement
                programs and achieve its goals.</p>
            <p>In 1992 soma-action in collaboration with UNHCR implemented over 48 projects through the Quick impact
                project
                for Somali refugees (QUIPS) in ElWak-Somalia and again Returnees to Somalia 1994. In 1999-2007, in
                collaboration with CARE SOMALIA, SOMA-ACTION implemented a food distribution project (RFSP) Rural food
                security project in 22 villages with 350MT of food each month in ElWaq Districts. The project was funded
                by
                USAID through CARE-SOMALIA for El-Niño affected communities.</p>
            <p>In early 1997, SOMA-ACTION field team participated in several organizational capacity-building trainings
                supported by CARE, UNICEF, UNHCR, WFP, CEWARN (IGAD), UN OCHA, and PACT-KENYA programs in ElWaq. In
                addition
                to small grants for office equipment and supplies, the training programs provided soma-action
                institutional
                capacity and staff development opportunities. These additional training and facilities gave SOMA-ACTION
                additional skills to manage its projects and resources even more effectively.</p>
            <p>In early 2000 SOMA-ACTION and COSV jointly implemented cash for work program through which communal dams
                and
                water catchments in pastoral areas of Lower Shebelle region were rehabilitated. In December 2001
                SOMA-ACTION
                implemented a UNICEF-funded HIV/AIDS awareness program in Elwak towns. A Series of workshops and
                seminars
                were organized for various community groups in the Districts.</p>
            <p>From March 2008- to July 2009 SOMA-ACTION in collaboration with WFP implemented general food distribution
                in
                24 villages in ElWaq- Somalia district. In early 2009, SOMA-ACTION implemented UNICEF funded Emergency
                provision of water through water trucking and hygiene promotion and rehabilitation of 18 water sources
                in El
                Waq District.</p>

            <div id="button3-content" class="hidden">
                <p>PACT has also given a Training of Trainers course on trauma healing and social reconciliation to Soma
                    Action staff. One trauma workshop was conducted in El Waqntown in collaboration with Gedo Peace
                    Consortium and the response from the participants was overwhelming. They felt that the trauma
                    awareness
                    and healing approach was the best to break the cycle of violence and have people who have been
                    afflicted
                    by violent conflict for 20 years cope and resume a sense of normalcy in their lives. During the
                    workshop, people who were formerly sworn enemies forgave each other, enabling dialogue and social
                    reconciliation. Currently (March 2011), SOMA ACTION, with support from UN OCHA is involved in
                    emergency
                    water provision in drought-afflicted settlements of ElWaqdistrict.</p>
                <p>Together with our International partners, SAIF has successfully implemented dozens of lifesaving
                    projects. Projects implemented over the years include the construction of water storage and
                    sanitation
                    facilities, pit latrines, cash relief, distribution of NFI's, and the management/renovation of
                    schools
                    and health sanitation facilities. We attribute our program's success to lasting relations with
                    communities, beneficiaries, and other stakeholders with whom we share our goal of delivering timely
                    and
                    relevant programming.</p>
                <p>Soma-Action has an establishment of good working relationship with communities- community acceptance
                    and
                    Recommendations from local Administration. SAIF has been trained in UNICEF’s WASH technical designs
                    and
                    the CLTS/ODF approach. Besides the construction of WASH facilities, the SAIF has acquired skills in
                    the
                    implementation of ODF strategy and one of its staff is a UNICEF trainer, in rolling out ODF training
                    of
                    facilitators across Somalia. SAIF in 2014 concluded the first phase of the CLTS/ODF flagship project
                    in
                    Gedo region. SAIF has been partnering with UNICEF for the implementation of a resilience program in
                    Elwaq and has also been the District focal point for AWD and flood response.</p>
                <p>The cross-border peace-building initiatives have also helped the waring community able to live
                    together
                    and share mega resources like water and pasture despite of constant drought/floods experienced in
                    the
                    region. SAIF has a lot of experience in implementing programs in Somalia and this is widely
                    contributed
                    by a highly experienced team of experts in this field of emergency and development programming.</p>
